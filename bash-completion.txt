1. How to enable command's bash completion?

By default, bash doesn't source completion files installed, for example,
"brew install tmux" install a bash completion file for tmux into, by default,
/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/tmux

So the only to do is ask your bash to source it when it starts, so just source
it in your ~/.profile
